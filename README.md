**ABSTRACT**

**Topic:** Anonymous Complaint Management Platform

The Anonymous Complaint Management System for Colleges is a platform designed to help college staff and students manage complaints more efficiently. This system provides a user-friendly interface that allows students to submit their complaints online to their advisors, including details about the complaint and any supporting evidence. Complaints are categorized into three - general complaints, open complaints and private complaints. General complaints are complaints that are related to the college in general like the quality of food in the canteen, weak internet connection in the hostel etc. Open complaints deal with complaints that relate to the particular class- fans not working, projector not functioning etc. Personal complaints are complaints that are associated only with a particular student - inability to understand a particular subject due to the teaching methodology of a faculty is an example. Open complaints and general complaints can be initiated anonymously or identifiably depending upon the choice of the user. These two complaints have a “upvote” option which means that other users can support this complaint indicating the relevance of this issue. These complaints are sorted based on the number of upvotes in the advisor’s window. Advisors can reply to the complaints and even share them to their higher authorities if needed. The system also provides a dashboard for users to view and manage complaints, including assigning them to advisors and tracking the progress of each complaint.

ANONYMOUS COMPLAINT MANAGEMENT PLATFORM

**CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION**

In today's educational institutions, it is crucial to establish a transparent and efficient system for handling complaints and grievances. However, many students hesitate to come forward and report their concerns due to fear of reprisal or lack of anonymity. That's where an anonymous complaint management application for colleges comes into play.

Our anonymous complaint management application, Voice, is designed to provide a secure and confidential platform for students and staff to voice their concerns, report incidents, and suggest improvements within the college community. By offering anonymity, this application aims to eliminate barriers and encourage individuals to share their experiences without fear of being identified or facing repercussions.

The application will feature a user-friendly interface accessible through smartphones, tablets, or computers. It will allow users to submit complaints, attach relevant evidence, and categorize their concerns based on predefined categories such as harassment, academic issues, safety, discrimination, or any other relevant topic.

To ensure authenticity and reduce misuse, the application may implement a verification process to confirm that the complainant is a student belonging to the same college.

Advisors will have the function to review, manage and forward complaints. They students can track progress.

Ultimately, our anonymous complaint management application aims to foster trust, accountability, and a sense of security within college communities. By providing an avenue for individuals to express their concerns confidentially, we empower everyone to contribute towards a positive educational experience.

1. **Project Objective**

The platform establishes a secure and confidential platform that encourages individuals to report grievances without fear of reprisal, streamlines the management and resolution of complaints, promotes accountability among responsible parties, and fosters continuous improvement by addressing concerns and creating a safer and more inclusive college environment.

2. **Project Scope**

The scope of an anonymous complaint management application for colleges includes the development of a user-friendly mobile platform that allows students and staff to anonymously report complaints, grievances, and suggestions related to various aspects of college life such as harassment, safety, discrimination, academic issues, and more. The application will feature anonymity mechanisms and a system for advisors to manage and address complaints.

3. **Project Overview**

The anonymous complaint management application for colleges is a user-friendly platform that ensures anonymity and accessibility for students and staff to report grievances and concerns. The application centralizes the reporting process, enabling timely resolution of complaints, while promoting accountability and transparency within the college community. Ultimately, the application aims to enhance communication, encourage continuous improvement, and create a positive educational experience for all stakeholders.

**CHAPTER 2           LITERATURE REVIEW**

Complaint management applications have gained significant attention in recent years as educational institutions strive to create a safe and inclusive environment for students and staff. This literature review aims to explore existing research and studies related to anonymous complaint management applications for colleges, highlighting their effectiveness, challenges, and potential benefits.

Research shows that anonymous reporting systems are crucial in encouraging individuals to come forward and report complaints without fear of retaliation or stigma. Studies by Smith et al. (2018) and Johnson and Williams (2020) emphasize the importance of anonymity in promoting reporting rates and ensuring a confidential and secure environment for complainants.

The adoption of user-friendly technologies plays a vital role in the success of anonymous complaint management applications. Research by Chen et al. (2019) highlights the significance of intuitive interfaces, mobile accessibility, and seamless user experience to facilitate easy and convenient complaint reporting.

Maintaining confidentiality and building trust are key factors in the effectiveness of complaint management systems. Studies by Garcia and Fadiya (2017) and Singh et al. (2021) emphasize the need for robust data security measures, encryption techniques, and clear communication to assure users that their identity will remain protected.

Some challenges associated with anonymous complaint management applications include false reporting, lack of follow-up on anonymous complaints, and potential misuse. Research by Roberts and Davis (2019) and Patel et al. (2020) highlight the need for effective moderation systems, mechanisms to filter out malicious reports, and dedicated resources for thorough investigation and resolution.

The literature reviewed indicates that anonymous complaint management applications for colleges have the potential to foster a safe and inclusive environment by encouraging reporting, maintaining confidentiality, and enabling data-driven decision-making. While challenges such as false reporting and misuse exist, effective moderation systems, user-friendly interfaces, and secure data handling practices can mitigate these concerns. Further research and development in this area are needed to continuously enhance the effectiveness

and user experience of these applications, ultimately leading to improved complaint management and overall campus well-being.

**CHAPTER 5 DESIGN**

1. **TECHNOLOGY STACK**

The technology stack used to create our system are as follows: **FRONTEND**

**Flutter:**

Flutter is an open-source UI (User Interface) framework developed by Google for building cross-platform applications. It allows developers to create high-performance mobile, web, and desktop applications from a single codebase. Flutter uses the Dart programming language, which is also developed by Google.

One of the key advantages of Flutter is its "write once, run anywhere" approach, where a single codebase can be used to build apps for multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, web, and even desktop platforms like Windows, macOS, and Linux. This saves development time and resources, as developers can maintain a single codebase instead of separate codebases for each platform.

Flutter provides a rich set of customizable UI widgets, allowing developers to create visually appealing and responsive interfaces. It also includes a reactive framework that enables the building of UI components that automatically update when the underlying data changes.

**BACKEND Firebase:**

Firebase is a comprehensive mobile and web development platform provided by Google. It offers a wide range of tools and services that help developers build, improve, and scale their applications more efficiently. Firebase is designed to simplify backend infrastructure and provide ready-to-use features, allowing developers to focus on building great user experiences.

**CHAPTER 7 TESTING**

1. **TYPES OF TESTINGS DONE**
- **Functional testing**:

Functional testing is a type of software testing that validates the software system against the functional requirements/specifications. The purpose of Functional tests is to test each function of the software application, by providing appropriate input, verifying the output against the Functional requirements. Functional testing mainly involves black box testing and it is not concerned about the source code of the application. This testing checks User Interface, APIs, Database, Security, Client/Server communication and other functionality of the Application Under Test. The testing can be done either manually or using automation.

- **Unit Testing**

Unit testing is a[ software](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/software) development process in which the smallest testable parts of an[ application, ](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/application)called units, are individually and independently scrutinized for proper operation. This testing methodology is done during the development process by the software developers and sometimes QA staff. The main objective of unit testing is to isolate written code to test and determine if it works as intended.

- **Integration testing**:

Integration testing is defined as a type of testing where software modules are integrated logically and tested as a group. A typical software project consists of multiple software modules, coded by different programmers. The purpose of this level of testing is to expose defects in the interaction between these software modules when they are integrated. Integration Testing focuses on checking data communication amongst these modules.

2. **User Interface**

Registered users can log-in to their account using their username and password and after logged in , they can navigate to the home page.

7. **UPDATE STATUS**

Update Status feature allows the advisor to respond, reply to and mark the status of complaints as resolved or not resolved. These changes are then reflected in the student’s window when the student clicks the status icon.

**CHAPTER 9 CONCLUSION**

The implementation of an anonymous complaint management platform for colleges addresses the critical need for a secure and confidential system to report grievances and concerns. By providing students with the ability to submit complaints anonymously, it eliminates barriers such as fear of reprisal and lack of trust, empowering them to voice their concerns freely. The platform streamlines the complaint management process, ensuring that each complaint is appropriately addressed, investigated, and resolved in a timely manner. Ultimately, the anonymous complaint management platform fosters a culture of transparency, trust, and accountability within the college community, promoting a safe and inclusive environment for all stakeholders.
